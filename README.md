S4X8 ProxyKicker
================

What is this?
-------------

This is a plugin for [Bukkit] made to block connections from anonymous and publicproxies like Tor exit nodes or SOCKS proxies at the Minecraft server [Mine21].

Installation
------------

To install the plugin on your Bukkit server, you may either [download the pre-built version], or compile it yourself.

To compile it yourself, you need [Oracle Java Development Kit] v1.6 or newer, [Maven 2], and Git. When you have all of them downloaded and installed, you have to grab the source code using GIT and compile it:

	git clone http://github.com/socram8888/ProxyKicker
	cd ProxyKicker
	mvn clean package
	
Maven will automatically download all the dependencies. It may take more than five minutes if you have a slow internet connection, but usually it will take less than a minute.

The resulting compiled Java Archive file (.jar) ready to be used will be at /target. Just move it (or copy it) to Bukkit's plugin folder.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration for the plugin is stored in a [YAML]-formatted configuration file at /plugins/ProxyKicker/config.yml:
	
	# ProxyKicker configuration file
	
	# Expiration of proxy list cache, in milliseconds. By default, a week. Setting this value to zero or less will disable caching.
	tor-update-interval: 604800000
	# Unix time of last update. This value should not be modified manually. A value of zero or less forces an update
	tor-update-date: -1
	
	# Put on this list feeds for the Tor exit nodes.
	tor-list:
	- http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ip_list_all.php/Tor_ip_list_ALL.csv
	
	# Every time an user connects, ProxyKicker will scan for these ports on his/her endpoint, and will kick him/her if one of the port is open
	proxy-ports:
	- 3127
	- 3128
	- 1080
	- 6666
	- 6668
	- 6667
	- 6673
	- 42321

This plugin will automatically download at startup a list Tor exit node database if tor.db does not exist or has expired.

You can skip checking for certain users by using PermissionsEx or another Bukkit Permission plugin and adding them the permission node "proxykicker.bypass".

About the author
----------------

My name is Marcos Vives Del Sol, aka "socram8888". I'm a 18-year-old Spanish guy who likes programming useless stuff that nobody uses. If you want to report a bug, ask for a new feature, or just say hello, you can contact me in my e-mail account <socram8888@gmail.com>.

This plugin is was based on a very mature version of proxykiller, programmed by jcarlosn (who also continued developing of the plugin - see [ZeroProxy]). This initially became as a fix for some race-condition bugs it had which made the server crash, and evolved into a full rewriting of the plugin. Right now, no line from the original code has been left.
